## Overall Grading Scale Implementation Notes

When calculating the overall grade, consider:

1. Distinct performance areas are weighted differently:
   - Agent Performance (40%): Response Time, Communication Quality, Process Adherence
   - Bot Performance (20%): Based on qualitative evaluation
   - Guest Experience (40%): Issue Resolution and Overall Experience

2. Context-specific adjustments:
   - For high-tier members or VIP guests, guest experience weight increases
   - For pre-stay inquiries, agent communication quality has higher significance
   - For complaint handling, issue resolution carries more weight
   - For routine inquiries, process adherence and response time are prioritized

The system should be calibrated periodically to ensure consistency and alignment with business priorities.
