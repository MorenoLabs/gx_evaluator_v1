## Overall Grading Scale Implementation Notes

When calculating the overall grade, consider:

1. Priority weighting based on ticket type and guest status
2. Particularly for high-tier members or VIP guests, response time and issue resolution should be weighted more heavily
3. For pre-stay inquiries, communication quality may have higher significance
4. For complaint handling, issue resolution and guest experience should receive greater weight
5. For routine informational inquiries, process adherence and response time may be prioritized

The system should be calibrated periodically to ensure consistency across evaluators and alignment with changing business priorities.
